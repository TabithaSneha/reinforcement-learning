# Reinforcement Learning

***

In this repository, Reinforcement Learning algorithms have been studied and implemented over various environments.

## Frozen Lake

Policy Iteration and Value Iteration Algorithms were implemented in the Frozen Lake environment given [here](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/).

## MiniGrid

SARSA, SARSA(<img src = https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\lambda>) and Q-Learning Algorithms were implemented in the MiniGrid environment given [here](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/gym-minigrid).

## Reinforcement Learning Project by UC Berkeley

Value Iteration, Q-Learning and Approximate Q-Learning Algorithms were implemented first on Gridworld and then applied to a simulated robot controller Crawler and Pacman as instructed [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp22/project6/).
